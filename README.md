# TCP-IP-multithreaded-generalknowledge-game
This project implements a multiplayer general knowledge quiz game using TCP/IP socket communication in C. The server coordinates the game by sending questions to all connected clients simultaneously. Each client submits answers in real time, and the first correct response earns a point and triggers the next question.
